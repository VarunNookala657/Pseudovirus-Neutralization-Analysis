## Overall Project Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the end-to-end process of acquiring, cleaning,
storing, analyzing, and visualizing complex public health data from APIs. Critical aspects like
handling nested JSON, inferring missing information, and implementing robust data filtering
were vital in transforming raw data into meaningful insights. The analysis highlighted the rapid
global response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in terms of vaccine research, identifying leading
countries and the prominence of various vaccine technologies, while also acknowledging the
inherent challenges in data completeness from public registries. The insights gained provide a
snapshot of the intense global scientific effort to combat COVID-19 through vaccination.
